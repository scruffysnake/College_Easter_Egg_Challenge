# College Easter Egg Challenge

This is a small collection of basic programming easter themed coding challenges.

Designed for the programming club at my Sixth-Form College, which I run

All programmed in C# as its the language of choice at my school

The Lib folder includes the main bulk of the code;
its a library that has all the code for the trials

Easter_Egg_Hunt is a basic project with the library from Lib already set up

Helper_Generate_Questions are scripts that were used to generate the constants used within the library and should be ignored

Sorry about there not being much documentation/comments, I have test on the same day as this due so I can't spend much time on this

## If you're a random person reading this
Feel free to edit and use this as you wish :3

It was made for a specific date so code maintainability wasn't really thought about (sorry) :p
